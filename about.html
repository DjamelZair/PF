            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Djamel, an ambitious and inquisitive optimist who thrives in team-oriented environments. I love connecting with people and having meaningful conversations. 
                While I constantly crave new knowledge, I also value the importance of respecting privacy and not letting my own biases influence others.</p>
        
            <p>When I was eight, I watched the movie <a href="https://youtu.be/_19pRsZRiz4?si=6UJUofTeOxN7uYbz" target="_blank">A.I. Artificial Intelligence</a>, which c
                hanged my life. It sparked my fascination with artificial intelligence, though at the time, it felt like something far off in the future.</p>
        
            <p>After nursing school, I initially aimed to become a doctor, so I pursued courses on the "mama-havo" track. During that time, I not only 
                fell in love with the exact sciences, but more importantly, I discovered that AI was a real field of study â€” one that was within reach.</p>
        
            <p>I worked as a nurse for about seven years. Though I miss it from time to time, I believe AI is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of our 
                healthcare systems. My journey eventually led me to work for institutions like ABN AMRO and Rabobank, where I realized the banking world holds a lot 
                of power making this a better world.</p>
        
            <p>Now, I'm fully committed to using AI and data science to make a real difference in industries like healthcare and banking/finance. I'm always eager to 
                learn more, solve new challenges, and collaborate with like-minded individuals.</p>
